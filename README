  I'm just pushing the latest changes out before I'll go on
  holiday, so at the moment it's not working 100% correctly.
  
  If you still want to play around you could:
    1) git checkout 0797b2a253e40103c8132374996c1dc9ed5aa4aa (old version)
    2) clone SexpTemplate and SexpBuilder (see github.com/judofyr) and
       put them in the load path at the top of lib/parkaby.rb
       
  I'll release it as a gem when I'll get back home.

= Parkaby, ParseTree meets Markaby

    In the beginning God created ERB. And ERB was waste and void;
    and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of
    God moved upon the face of the templates. And God said, Let
    there be Ruby: and there was Markaby.
    
                                ~~ Genesis 1:1-3, The Template Engine Bible

Ruby is nice. I think that's something we all can agree on. When you suddenly
need to output some HTML in the middle of your app, it's very convenient to
continue writing Ruby, instead of switching to String and interpolation.
That's where Markaby comes in:

  mab {
    html {
      head {
        title "happy title"
      }
      body {
        h1 "happy heading"
        a "a link", "href" => "url"
      }
    }
  }
  
Of course, we all know that Ruby is slow. Needless to say, that makes Markaby
slow too. Not even Tagz, Ryan Davis' fast Markaby-clone, can't stand a chance
against Erubis and Haml. It's time we fight back. Let's show them that pure,
readable Ruby can get on par with percent signs and forced indentations:

  Parkaby {
    html {
      head {
        title "happy title"
      }
      body {
        h1 "happy heading"
        a "a link", "href" => "url"
      }
    }
  }
  
See, no changes at all, but take a look at the benchmark:

  ~> ruby bench/run.rb simple 10000
  
                             user     system      total        real
  Erubis                 0.030000   0.000000   0.030000 (  0.022264)
  Haml                   0.110000   0.000000   0.110000 (  0.117887)
  Parkaby (def_method)   0.130000   0.000000   0.130000 (  0.135996)
  Parkaby (render)       0.150000   0.010000   0.160000 (  0.150680)
  Parkaby (inline)       0.970000   0.000000   0.970000 (  0.988010)
  Tagz                   3.250000   0.040000   3.290000 (  3.400699)
  Markaby               12.610000   0.140000  12.750000 ( 13.067794)
      
Okay, with all respect: this is a really crappy benchmark. Luckily, the Haml
guys have written a very nasty template:

  ~> ruby bench/run.rb nasty 500
  
                             user     system      total        real
  Erubis                 0.190000   0.010000   0.200000 (  0.198487)
  Parkaby (def_method)   0.350000   0.000000   0.350000 (  0.363106)
  Parkaby (render)       0.360000   0.010000   0.370000 (  0.365007)
  Parkaby (inline)       0.570000   0.000000   0.570000 (  0.614286)
  Haml                   2.490000   0.030000   2.520000 (  2.620025)
  Tagz                   5.100000   0.060000   5.160000 (  5.394778)
  Markaby                7.220000   0.090000   7.310000 (  7.630588)
     
That's more like it!

It's still not a truly fair comparision though. Both Parkaby, Tagz and Markaby
escapes all input, while in Erubis and Haml you'll need to explicitly mark it
where needed. In the nasty template, nearly nothing needs to be escaped, so
Parkaby, Tagz and Markaby are doing a lot of escaping for nothing!

  ~ ~ UPDATE  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
  
  Nathan Weizenbaum reports in: "You say in the Parkaby docs that in Haml you
  need to manually mark escaping, but that's not true. Haml supports an
  option (:escape_html) that makes it default to escaping all input."

In a real-life scenario you want to escape nearly everything which comes from
the user, so I'm still looking for a better template to run benchmarks on.

= Synopsis

  require 'lib/parkaby'
  
  before = self
  
  ## inline
  Parkaby {
  
    self == before # => true
    
    self << "<!DOCTYPE html>"
    # or: text "<!DOCTYPE html>"
    
    html {
    
      head { something }        # tag unless self.respond_to?(:head)
      tag.head { something }    # force a tag
      self.head { something }   # force a method call
      
      span "<em>Escape!</em>" # => "<span>&lt;em&gt;Escape!&lt;/em&gt;</span>"
      span { "<em>No escape!</em>" } # => "<span><em>No escape!</em></span>"
      
      div {
        strong "Ruby!"  # You can't mix tags
        "Silent."       # and return values in blocks
      } # => "<div><strong>Ruby!</strong></div>"
      
      a "something", :href => 'http://google.com'
      
      a(:href => 'http://google.com') { "something else" } 
    }
    
  } # => lots of html
  
  ## Using Parkaby::Template
  
  temp = Parkaby::Template.string('strong self')
  #    = Parkaby::Template.block { strong self }
  
  ctemp = temp.compile(Helpers)
  ctemp.render("Ruby!") # => "<strong>Ruby!</strong>"
  
  temp.def_method(String, :strong)                  
  "Ruby!".strong # => "<strong>Ruby!</strong>" 
  
= More

The easiest way to use Parkaby is simply to pass in a block:

  Parkaby { html { ... } } # => "<html>...</html>"

Let's however take a look at how to use Parkaby::Template:

  temp = Parkaby::Template.string('html { ... }')
  temp = Parkaby::Template.block { html { ... } }
  
After you got a Parkaby::Template, you'll have to compile it to a
Parkaby::CompiledTemplate. There are two types of a compiled template: One
that stores the template as a string, and one that stores it as a proc. The
latter is quite a lot faster the former, but if you're going to evaluate the
template under a binding, you'll have to use a string.

You also have to give it a helper object when you compile it. This makes sure
it won't turn methods into HTML-blocks if they exist on the helper object.
(You can however always prepend the method with "self." to force a method
call.)

 ctemp = temp.compile_as_string(helper || binding)
 ctemp = temp.compile_as_proc(helper || binding)

 temp.compile(binding) == temp.compile_as_string(binding)
 temp.compile(helper)  == temp.compile_as_proc(helper)

After you've compiled it, you just call #render with the object that you want
to be `self`, or the binding it should be called with. Notice that both
compile_as_proc and compile_as_string supports both bindings and regular
objects as arguments (same goes for their #render). They're smart enough to
convert it the way they want it.

You can also use Template#def_method to define it as a method on an object:

  temp.def_method(String, :cool)
  "awesome".cool
  
  obj = Object.new
  temp.def_method(obj, :cool)
  obj.cool
  
  # Use :instance_eval to make it a class method on a class
  temp.def_method(String, :cool, :instance_eval)
  String.cool

= How

It's quite obvious that Parkaby is fast. How? The secret ingredient is:
ParseTree! ParseTree turns this:

  html {
    head {
      title "happy title"
    }
    body {
      h1 "happy heading"
      a "a link", "href" => "url"
    }
  }

into this:

  s(:iter,
   s(:call, nil, :html, s(:arglist)),
   nil,
   s(:block,
    s(:iter,
     s(:call, nil, :head, s(:arglist)),
     nil,
     s(:call, nil, :title, s(:arglist, s(:str, "happy title")))),
    s(:iter,
     s(:call, nil, :body, s(:arglist)),
     nil,
     s(:block,
      s(:call, nil, :h1, s(:arglist, s(:str, "happy heading"))),
      s(:call,
       nil,
       :a,
       s(:arglist,
        s(:str, "a link"),
        s(:hash, s(:str, "href"), s(:str, "url"))))))))

then Parkaby::Processor turns it into this:

  s(:parkaby,
   :begin,
   s(:parkaby,
    :blocktag, 
    :html,  
    s(:block,         
     s(:parkaby,
      :blocktag,
      :head,
      s(:parkaby, :tag, :title, s(:str, "happy title"), nil),
      nil),
     s(:parkaby,
      :blocktag,
      :body,
      s(:block,
       s(:parkaby, :tag, :h1, s(:str, "happy heading"), nil),
       s(:parkaby,
        :tag,
        :a,
        s(:str, "a link"),
        s(:hash, s(:str, "href"), s(:str, "url")))),
      nil)),
    nil))
    
and Parkaby::Generator turns that into this:

  _parkaby_buffer = [_parkaby_current = []]
  _parkaby_current << "<html>"
  _parkaby_buffer << (_parkaby_current = [])
  _parkaby_value = begin
  (_parkaby_current << "<head>"
  _parkaby_buffer << (_parkaby_current = [])
  _parkaby_value = begin
  _parkaby_current << "<title>happy title</title>"
  end
  _parkaby_current << _parkaby_value if _parkaby_current.empty?
  _parkaby_current << '</head>'
  _parkaby_current << "<body>"
  _parkaby_buffer << (_parkaby_current = [])
  _parkaby_value = begin
  (_parkaby_current << "<h1>happy heading</h1>"
  _parkaby_current << "<a href=\"url\">a link</a>"
  )
  end
  _parkaby_current << _parkaby_value if _parkaby_current.empty?
  _parkaby_current << '</body>'
  )
  end
  _parkaby_current << _parkaby_value if _parkaby_current.empty?
  _parkaby_current << '</html>'
  _parkaby_buffer.join 
  
In this specific example you can clearly see that we still have quite a few
optimizations left until it's perfect, but it's still 23 times faster than
Markaby's:

  mab {
    html {
      head {
        title "happy title"
      }
      body {
        h1 "happy heading"
        a "a link", "href" => "url"
      }
    }
  }

= Notes

* Parkaby doesn't change `self` at all.
* It's smart (maybe too smart):
  * Parkaby { li "I", "got", "three arguments" }     # => NoMethodError
  * Parkaby { li({:hash => :fist}, "content after")} # => NoMethodError
  * Parkaby { self.li }                              # => NoMethodError
  * Parkaby { li } # => "<li/>"
  * def li end; Parkaby { li } # => ""
* Currently, you must give it a Hash-literal for the attributes. [BUG]
* CssProxy and capture isn't implemented yet.
* I'm thinking of adding a a follow-feature: when it sees `follow.some_method`
  it fetches the method definition and inlines it in the main template.
* Yes, this is very experimental and I don't think anyone is ever going to use 
  it.
